        <div class="title-subtext">Heat Death is a hypothesis about the ultimate state of the universe- one of maximum
            entropy.
            Applying the second rule of thermodynamics (total entropy within a closed system must increase irreversably
            to some extent over time),
            if the universe is an isolated system, then its entropy must increase with time. The implication
            is that the universe must ultimately suffer a “heat death” as its entropy progressively increases toward a
            maximum value
            and all parts come into thermal equilibrium at a uniform temperature. After that point, no further changes
            involving the
            conversion of heat into useful work are possible.</div>
