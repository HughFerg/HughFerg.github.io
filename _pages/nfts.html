<h2>
    Most NFT Art is Horrible - It’s Still Valuable
</h2>
<br>
<p>
    NFTs have ferociously taken over art and the internet in a short amount of time. The topic is confusing, frustrating
    and
    tends to engender emotionally charged reactions. But you don’t need a technical understanding to understand the most
    common refrain about popular NFTs: ‘Why do they look like that? Why are they so ugly?’ Interesting discourse for
    something that must, on some level, be about art. However the discussion around them would have you believe NFTs are
    about anything but, its ethos instead being the activity and ecosystem of markets and speculation. Rarely is there
    discussion of the actual work you are buying.
<br>
<br>
    You can just think of NFTs as digital artworks. As we will see, the mechanical differences between NFTs and the
    traditional art market are not especially dramatic. You can find better explanations in lots of other places.

<br>
<br>
    Many NFTs are grouped into collections. Usually they are grouped around some theme, some more popular collections
    being
    series’ of people or character avatars. Note that ‘popular’ here denotes what most would interpret as a gross
    overvaluation. The top collections trade millions of dollars in volume a day and billions all time.

<br>
<br>
    Most people agree these images are at best mildly interesting and at worst reflections of exasperatingly bad taste
    and
    faith. Is anyone actually buying these because they like the artwork or want to support the artists involved? Of
    course
    not. They are buying them because they have the money to speculate on something absurdly overhyped[1]. The ugliness of
    popular NFT collections is not an artistic choice so much as a result of cheap, procedural generation which allows
    thousands of unique pieces to be minted automatically. This leads to lifeless base art whose plainness is necessary
    to
    accommodate so much variation. Other collections opt for incredibly basic pixel art, leaving less to offend the eye
    but
    little of substance in its place.
<br>
<br>
    A disturbing undercurrent of racism runs through certain popular NFT collections. One of the most popular, Bored Ape
    Yacht Club, utilizes anthropomorphized apes with various traits and clothing. The comparison of groups of people to
    primates has long been a racist tactic of dehumanization, especially to Black people, and BAYC is rife with numerous
    subtle neo-nazi references in their logo and imagery, as well as not so subtle “hip-hop” gold chains and “sushi
    chef”
    kamikaze headbands. Many of these references will pass over people’s heads but there are very real ramifications for
    the
    spread of such ideology, and already racist offshoots have followed in their place.
<br>
<br>
    Rich, mostly-white men trading images of monkeys worth millions of dollars on the OpenSea[2]. The whole thing feels
    like a
    bizarre performance art, but disturbing visual evidence and the history of the alt-right in crypto suggest this is
    more
    than coincidence.

<br>
<br>

    Another symptom of the lack of crypto regulation is in the rampant theft of others’ art achieved through minting
    NFTs of
    a piece of work (say, an image) without the actual artist’s permission. There are efforts to catch and remove
    instances of
    this, but a lot slips through anyway. There is nothing in the NFT process that guarantees the money is being sent
    to
    the ‘right’ person. This uncertainty, grating against blockchain’s promises of trust and security, often requires a
    buyer to verify the art by checking the artists on some other legitimate source and serves as another barrier for
    new
    entrants.
<br>
<br>

    Many of these issues are generalizations, and just because many of these images are not necessarily
    conventionally beautiful does not mean that some others can’t enjoy their aesthetic. For some, having a part in this
    ecosystem- especially with the energy of devoted detractors and supporters- is a means of genuine connection through
    digital means. More attention should be paid to how NFTs can help support community and identity. It’s hard
    to
    imagine them garnering as much attention if they did not have some power in that regard. As a society, the trend
    will be
    more time spent in digital spaces, not less. NFTs will and should not replace physical art or any number of
    real-world
    concerns, but the last 20 years have shown that what happens on the internet matters. We should focus on developing
    exciting and expressive ways of existing online and NFTs have a chance to contribute to that.
<br>
<br>

    The backlash itself is valuable too. To many, NFTs continue to represent everything wrong with traditional art, but
    the
    NFT is just a medium. They also offer a chance to explore everything that is right with digital art.
    Artists
    whose tokens allow access to exclusive works or discussion, new digital signifiers around causes and movements;
    there is
    power and potential in this technology. There are many issues with the current concept of an NFT that hold back its
    cultural and artistic acceptance. But there is very much a forest behind the trees.
<br>
<br>

    Art feels like it’s been eating itself alive for a bit now. Earlier last year a blockchain firm bought a $95,000
    Banksy
    and burned it, filming the event and auctioning it off as an NFT for $380,000. The print itself was titled Morons
    and
    depicted a traditional art auction at Christies. Art-destruction-as-art isn't exactly an original concept- we can go
    all
    the way back to the sphinx for that one. But it’s the kind of thing that can be vindicated by the amount of feathers
    ruffled. How many times can you iterate on Duchamp’s Fountain? I guess as many times as people will react to it.
<br>
<br>

    This is performance art. To restrict the arts to aesthetics or a medium is to severely underestimate it. The only way
    that
    more valuable projects will emerge is if we talk about them more than the others.
<br>
<br>

    Art has always been about conveying information, and ‘modern’ art has continued to expand the scope of that
    information
    far beyond aesthetic beauty. Just like streetwear before it, its growth shows that these shitty images can compete
    and
    excel against traditional art houses like Christie’s, mocking them for entertaining the notion in the first place.
    Maybe
    the art world could use a little vulgarity and fourth wall breaking. It’s not quite art for the masses, but it can
    take
    us a step closer.

[1] - I will not tackle the idea of ‘fair’ valuations here, especially in what is ostensibly the art world. Its speculative
nature is the intended trait. You can argue for the same property in the highest fine art auctions, and I probably would. We as modern humans are almost always talking about a market, where the price of a work
is inseparable from the art.
