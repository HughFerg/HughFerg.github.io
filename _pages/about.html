    I'm a developer, a student, but more so an avid follower of my interests. This site is for that and the inbetween.

    I'm currently a sophmore at Northeastern University, studying Computer Science and Finance. When that's not happening, I live in my hometown in Long Island, NY. My ultimate career goals are uncertain, but I strongly believe in the idea that <i>"Silicon Valley is a bunch of big minds working on small ideas."</i>
    <br><br>Along with my much more impressive friend Josh Farahzad, we started 
    <a href="missiontoothbrush.org" target="_blank">mission: toothbrush</a>
    , a nonprofit dedicated to providing oral health supplies to underprivileged families on Long Island.
