    I'm a developer, a student, but more so an avid follower of my interests. This site is for that and the inbetween.
    <div style="font-weight: 130%; font-size: 150%; text-transform: uppercase; text-decoration: underline; padding-top: 2rem; padding-bottom: 1rem;">The Boring</div>
    I'm currently a sophmore at Northeastern University, studying Computer Science and Finance. When that's not happening, I live in my hometown in Long Island, NY. My ultimate career goals are uncertain, but I strongly believe in the idea that <i>"Silicon Valley is a bunch of big minds working on small ideas."</i>
