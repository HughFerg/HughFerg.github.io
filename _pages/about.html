    </a>I'm a developer, a student, but mostly an avid follower of my interests. This site is for that and the inbetween.
    <div class="about-subheadings">The Boring</div>I'm currently a sophomore at Northeastern University, studying Computer Science and Economics in the Honors Program. When that's not happening, I live in my hometown in Long Island, NY. My ultimate career goals are uncertain, but I strongly believe in the idea that <i>"Silicon Valley is a bunch of big minds working on small ideas."</i>
    <div class="about-subheadings">The Less Boring</div>Along with my much more impressive friend Josh Farahzad, we started mission: toothbrush, 
    a nonprofit dedicated to providing oral health supplies to underprivileged families on Long Island.

    </div>We've both stepped away from day-to-day operations, which are handled now by our fantastic leadership team. We oversee mission: toothbrush on the board,
    and hope that our growth, as well as the growth of everyone that has a hand in its success, will allow us to be making a difference for many years to come.<div style="padding: 2rem;"></div>The project I'm most currently working on is Operation: Space. We're trying to break the student rocket altitude record with a team of the most talented 
    students from across the country, and I think that's cool as hell. We're scheduled for a launch in May of 2019 from Spaceport America in New Mexico.

    </div>I'm currently an associate software engineer at Wolters Kluwer in Boston, MA. I also freelance websites, record music, and spend too much time reading on the internet. I try and follow politics only up to the point where it doesn't stress me out,
    and I'm really interested in public policy + legal lag as it relates to technology. I also like having strong opinions on movies immediately after I see them,
    and an online Harry Potter quiz once told me that I belong in Hufflepuff (which I'm still not happy about).
