quote: '"So there I was, back at the office the next day. I was feeling unfilfilled and, frankly, rather crappy about everything. I wasn''t going anywhere and neither was the rest of the world. We were all just hanging around waiting to die and meanwhile doing little things to fill the space. Some of us weren''t even doing the little things. We were vegetables. I was one of those. I don''t know what kind of vegetable I was. I felt like a turnip. I lit a cigar, inhaled, and pretended that I knew what the hell."'
